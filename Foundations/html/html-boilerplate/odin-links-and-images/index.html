Links are created using the <a> (anchor) element.

An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is written as a name–value pair inside the opening tag.

The href attribute specifies the destination URL of a link.

When using target="_blank" to open links in a new tab or window, rel="noopener noreferrer" must be included to prevent the new page from accessing the original page and to protect user privacy.

An absolute link includes the full URL (protocol and domain), while a relative link points to a resource based on the current file’s location.

Images are displayed using the <img> element, which is a void element and does not have a closing tag.

Images must always include the src attribute to specify the image path and the alt attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.

The parent directory in a filepath is accessed using ..

The four main image formats used on the web are JPEG, PNG, GIF, and SVG.
