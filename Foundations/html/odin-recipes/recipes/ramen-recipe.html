    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 tsps red curry paste</li>
            <li>2 tsps curry powder</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. 
                Once the pot is hot, add the pork and cook, 
                undisturbed, 4-5 minutes, or until the bottom 
                is crispy. Continue to cook, breaking up the meat
                up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked 
                through, 6 to 8 minutes more. Transfer the pork to a plate. Drain off any excess fat. 
                Add the sesame oil to the same  pot. Once the oil is glistening, add the garlic and ginger 
                and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li>Add the red curry paste and yellow curry powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, chicken stock, soy sauce, mushrooms, bok choy, green onions, and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally until the bok choy is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ramen noodles and pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes.
