    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Gyudon is a Japanese beef bowl consisting of thinly sliced fatty beef and onions in a lightly sweet mixture of mirin and soy sauce. Serve it over rice with a fried egg for a simple and delicious meal!
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium onions</li>
            <li>1 pound very thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup dashi stock</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.
            </li>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!             
            </li>

            <li>
                When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.
            </li>
        
        
        </ol>
