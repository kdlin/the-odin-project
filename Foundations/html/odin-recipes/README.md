Description: A basic recipe project with 2 recipes and a home page. Built with only HTML and the first real project in the Foundations part of The Odin Project

Throughout the project I practiced: 
  - Building multi-page websites with proper HTML structure    
  - Using semantic HTML elements (headings, lists,
  paragraphs)
  - Working with relative paths for navigation between
  pages
  - Embedding images in web pages
  - Version control with Git and GitHub
