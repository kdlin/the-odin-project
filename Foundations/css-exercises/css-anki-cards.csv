What does CSS stand for?;Cascading Style Sheets
What are the three ways to add CSS to HTML?;"1. Inline styles (style attribute)<br>2. Internal stylesheet (&lt;style&gt; tag in &lt;head&gt;)<br>3. External stylesheet (&lt;link&gt; tag to .css file)"
Which method of adding CSS is considered best practice and why?;External stylesheet - keeps HTML and CSS separate, allows reusability across multiple pages, and maintains clean code organization
What is the basic syntax of a CSS rule?;selector { property: value; }
What are the three basic CSS selectors?;"1. Element selector (p, div, h1)<br>2. Class selector (.classname)<br>3. ID selector (#idname)"
How do you select multiple elements with one rule in CSS?;"Use commas to separate selectors: p, div, h1 { color: red; }"
What does "cascade" mean in CSS?;The cascade is the algorithm that determines which CSS rules apply when multiple rules target the same element
What are the three factors that determine which CSS rule wins in the cascade (in order)?;"1. Specificity (most important)<br>2. Source order (when specificity is equal)<br>3. Inheritance"
How is CSS specificity calculated? What is the (0-0-0) format?;"(ID - CLASS - ELEMENT)<br>First digit: Number of ID selectors<br>Second digit: Number of class selectors, attributes, pseudo-classes<br>Third digit: Number of element/type selectors"
Calculate the specificity: .header .nav li;(0-2-1) - 2 classes and 1 element
Calculate the specificity: #main p.highlight;(1-1-1) - 1 ID, 1 class, 1 element
Which selector has higher specificity: div.text or .text.child?;.text.child (0-2-0) beats div.text (0-1-1)
What is a descendant selector in CSS?;A selector with a space between parts that targets elements nested inside other elements. Example: .parent .child selects .child inside .parent
What is a compound selector in CSS?;Multiple selectors written together WITHOUT spaces, targeting elements that have ALL specified classes/attributes. Example: .class1.class2
What's the difference between ".para .small" and ".para.small"?;".para .small" selects .small INSIDE .para (descendant)<br>".para.small" selects elements with BOTH classes (compound)
What's the difference between ".para, .small" and ".para.small"?;".para, .small" selects ALL .para elements AND ALL .small elements (group selector)<br>".para.small" selects ONLY elements with both classes (compound)
When two CSS rules have the same specificity, which one wins?;The last one in the source order (the one that appears later in the CSS file)
What is inheritance in CSS?;Some CSS properties (like color, font) are passed from parent elements to their children automatically
What keyboard shortcut opens Developer Tools in most browsers?;F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
How do you inspect a specific element on a webpage?;Right-click on the element and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
In DevTools, how can you temporarily edit CSS to test changes?;Click on any CSS property or value in the Styles panel and edit it directly (changes are temporary)
What does the "Computed" tab show in DevTools?;The final calculated styles that are actually applied to an element after all CSS rules are processed
How can you see which CSS file and line number a style comes from in DevTools?;Look at the right side of each CSS rule in the Styles panel - it shows filename:line-number
What do crossed-out styles in DevTools indicate?;Styles that are being overridden by other rules with higher specificity or later source order
What are the four parts of the CSS Box Model (from inside to outside)?;"1. Content<br>2. Padding<br>3. Border<br>4. Margin"
What does padding do in the box model?;Adds space INSIDE the element, between the content and the border. Background color extends into padding.
What does margin do in the box model?;Adds space OUTSIDE the element, creating distance between elements. Margin is always transparent.
What's the difference between padding and margin?;Padding is inside the border (background color shows), margin is outside the border (always transparent)
How do you set different values for each side with padding/margin?;padding: top right bottom left; (clockwise from top)<br>OR use individual properties: padding-top, padding-right, etc.
What is the shorthand for padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px?;padding: 10px;
What is the shorthand for margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px?;margin: 10px 20px; (vertical horizontal)
What does box-sizing: border-box do?;Makes width and height include padding and border (instead of just content)
By default, if an element has width: 100px, padding: 10px, and border: 5px, what's its total width?;130px (100 + 10*2 + 5*2) - content + padding + border
What is margin collapse?;When vertical margins of adjacent elements touch, they collapse into a single margin (the larger one wins)
Do horizontal margins collapse?;No, only vertical (top and bottom) margins collapse
What are the characteristics of block-level elements?;"1. Take up full width available<br>2. Start on a new line<br>3. Can have width, height, margin, and padding on all sides"
Name 5 common block-level elements;"div, p, h1-h6, ul, li, section, article, header, footer, main"
What are the characteristics of inline elements?;"1. Only take up as much width as needed<br>2. Don't start on a new line<br>3. Can't set width or height<br>4. Vertical margin and padding don't affect layout"
Name 5 common inline elements;"span, a, strong, em, img, button, input, label, code"
Can you put a block element inside an inline element?;No, it's invalid HTML (though browsers may still render it)
What does display: inline-block do?;Makes an element behave like inline (sits on same line) but allows width, height, and vertical margin/padding like block
How do you change a &lt;span&gt; to behave like a block element?;display: block;
How do you change a &lt;div&gt; to behave like an inline element?;display: inline;
What's the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?;display: none removes element from layout completely<br>visibility: hidden hides element but preserves its space
Can you set width and height on inline elements?;No, width and height are ignored on inline elements (except replaced elements like img)
What happens when you add vertical margin to an inline element?;It has no effect - vertical margins don't work on inline elements
If .button has background: white and #confirm-button has background: green, what color is an element with id="confirm-button" class="button"?;Green - ID selector (1-0-0) beats class selector (0-1-0)
Write a selector that targets only &lt;p&gt; elements with both classes "text" and "bold";p.text.bold
What's wrong with this selector: .parent.child (if trying to select .child inside .parent)?;Missing space - should be .parent .child for descendant selector
How would you select all direct children of a div with class "container"?;.container > *
If two rules have specificity (0-1-0) and (0-0-2), which wins?;(0-1-0) wins - one class beats two elements
What unit is best for font-size: px, em, or rem? Why?;rem is often best - relative to root font size, predictable, and allows user scaling
